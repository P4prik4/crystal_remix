This is an attempt to get a working Crystal icon theme for KDE Plasma 5, by combining/mixing different versions of the Crystal icon theme (that were created for KDE 3 desktop). Personally, I think Crystal is the best ever icon theme for the Linux desktop, and I'd like to be able to continue using it on my KDE Plasma 5 desktop.

License: The original Crystal icon sets were licensed under the LGPL.

To install, copy the Crystal Remix folder to the system's icon themes folder (e.g. /usr/share/icons).
